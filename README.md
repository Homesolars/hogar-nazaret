# Repo for hogar-nazaret
The repo for the website for the Hogar Albergue para Niños Jesús de Nazaret. It is build on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), an open source project based on Ruby.

Having our site built on Jekyll, allows us to generate a static website which can be hosted on Github Pages, reducing our cost and allowing us to host the code on Github.
