# Repo for hogar-nazaret
The repo for the website for the Hogar Albergue para Niños Jesús de Nazaret. It is build on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), an open source project based on Ruby.

Having our site built on Jekyll, allows us to generate a static website which can be hosted on Github Pages, reducing our cost and allowing us to host the code on Github.

### Development Setup
Working on it...

### Development Notes
1. To standardize file configuration (tabs vs. spaces, newlines at the end of files), we use [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/). For a lot of text editors, you can install the EditorConfig extension and it will automatically configure any file you add or change.
