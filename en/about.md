The Hogar Albergue para Niños Jesús de Nazaret, Inc. (Hogar) is a transitory home for boys and girls that have been victims of abuse.

We provide a safe and positive living environment for the kids, ensuring that all their basic needs are met while showering them with tender, loving care. Our Hogar is located in the city of Mayagüez, and it is registered as a non-profit organization with the Puerto Rico State Department (under number 21,066) and as a 501c (3) with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.

Our Hogar was founded by Don Jesús Morales and his wife Carmen Cordero de Morales in 1991, and opened its doors in May 1995. Aware of the growing incidence of child abuse, a group of devoted community leaders worked tirelessly for almost five years to make the project a reality.

Our Hogar receives children from newborn to 11 years of age from all over Puerto Rico. The boys and girls receive personal attention, medical care, balanced nutrition, transportation, educational tutoring, recreational and cultural activities, and the professional social and psychological support necessary for their emotional and physical wellbeing.

We have an Executive Director who manages the staff and the day-to-day operations of the Hogar, and a volunteer Board of Directors that provides strategic and fiscal guidance. In addition, a group of kind and dedicated volunteers assists with important administrative and development activities, including proposal writing, fund-raising, marketing & communications, and event relations.

We invite you to join the Hogar’s family by becoming a Padrino (Godfather) o Madrina (Godmother) and provide your time and/or monthly financial donations to help fund the children’s services.  For information on how to get involved, please contact us at +1 787 831 6161 or complete the form on the ‘Contact Us’ section of this website. 

We look forward to hearing from you!
