Last January 15, we launched a project for the installation of a solar energy system at the Hogar. This project is possible thanks to Dr. James Tinjum and a group of graduate engineering students from the U. of Wisconsin in Madison and sponsored by Engineers Without Borders and the Puerto Rico Relief Fund of SE Wisconsin. Many thanks to all involved!
